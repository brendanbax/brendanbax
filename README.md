Hey I'm Brendan and I'm a designer and developer.

I started out studying 3D modeling and game art in college.  After graduating I spent time as a graphic designer before knuckling down and learning to code.

Currently I work as a UX Architect doing human-centered design with a bigger corporation in St. Louis.  I really like web development and enjoy writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Vue and React).  I feel like I shine best on front-end apps because of my design background and passion for inclusive usability.

I'd like to collaborate on some cool projects: 2D games, 3D games, anything iOS, React web stuff.
