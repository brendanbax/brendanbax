Hey I'm Brendan and I'm a digital maker.

I studied Computer Animation and Game Aart at Full Sail University back in 2010.

After graduating I spent time as a graphic designer before knuckling down and learning to code.

Currently I work as a JavaScript developer, building apps with Vue.js.

Prior development experience includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (including Vue, React Web, React Native, and Node).

I'm always open to collaborating on fun projects, [hit me up](https://www.brendanbax.com/contact) to work on games or web stuff.
