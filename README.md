### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some projects as a developer with [World Wide Technology](https://www.wwt.com), building some great tools for creating all that technology content.

ðŸŒ± Currently learning Vue.js as that's our tool of choice.  I recently converted my personal site [brendanbax.com](https://www.brendanbax.com) to Nuxt using Vue.

âš¡ Fun fact: I used to be a licensed realtor, hand-dyed yarn, and taught at a college
