Hey I'm Brendan and I'm a digital maker.

I studied Computer Animation and Game Aart at Full Sail University back in 2010.

After graduating I spent time as a graphic designer before knuckling down and learning to code.

Currently I work as a UX Architect doing human-centered design in St. Louis, MO and in my free time I'm taking Harvard's CS50x, and learning Swift.

Prior development experience includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Vue, React Web, React Native, Node).

I'm always open to collaborating on fun projects, hit me up for work on 2D/3D games, anything iOS, and web stuff.
