Hey I'm Brendan and I'm a digital maker.

I started out studying 3D modeling and game art in college.  After graduating I spent time as a graphic designer before knuckling down and learning to code.

Currently I work as a UX Architect doing human-centered design in St. Louis, MO and in my free time I'm taking Harvard's CS50x, and learnign Swift.

Prior development experience includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Vue, React Web, React Native, Node).

I'm always open to collaborating on fun projects, hit me up for work on 2D/3D games, anything iOS, and web stuff.
