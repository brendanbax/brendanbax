### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Brendan and I'm a designer and developer from St. Charles, MO.

#### Current Projects ðŸ”­

Currently I'm working on some projects as a developer with [World Wide Technology](https://www.wwt.com), building some great tools for creating all that technology content.

#### Learning ðŸŒ±
Currently learning Vue.js as that's our tool of choice.  I recently converted my personal site [brendanbax.com](https://www.brendanbax.com) to Nuxt using Vue.

#### Fun Facts âš¡
I used to be a licensed realtor, hand-dyed yarn, and taught at a college
