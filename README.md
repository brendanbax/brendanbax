Hey I'm Brendan and I'm a digital maker.

I studied Computer Animation and Game Aart at Full Sail University back in 2010.

After graduating I spent time as a graphic designer before knuckling down and learning to code.

Currently I work as a UX Architect doing human-centered design in St. Louis, MO.

In my free time I'm taking [Harvard's CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/), and reading [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/).

Prior development experience includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Vue, React Web, React Native, Node).

I'm always open to collaborating on fun projects, [hit me up](https://www.brendanbax.com/contact) for work on 2D/3D games or web stuff.
